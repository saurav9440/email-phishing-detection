That README is **short, clean, and recruiter-friendly** — it works well if you want something quick without too many technical walls of text.

But I’d suggest **two tweaks** to make it stand out more for a resume/GitHub viewer:

1. **Add a project structure block** so they immediately see it’s well-organized.
2. **Add a short “Future Improvements”** section to show you’re thinking ahead.

Here’s your version with those small upgrades:

# Email Phishing Detection

## Overview

This project detects phishing emails using NLP and Machine Learning. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression** to classify emails as either phishing or legitimate.

## Features

* Preprocess email text (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization)
* Extract TF-IDF features
* Train and evaluate ML model
* Streamlit-based web UI for live predictions

## Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, Streamlit

## Dataset

[Phishing Email Dataset - Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

## Future Improvements

* Integrate BERT for better accuracy
* Add API for email client integration
* Multi-language phishing detection support

If you want, I can also give you a **requirements.txt** that exactly matches this setup so it’s plug-and-play. That way, anyone who clones your repo can run it without troubleshooting dependencies.
