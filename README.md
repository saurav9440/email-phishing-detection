## Overview

This project detects phishing emails using NLP and Machine Learning. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression** to classify emails as either phishing or legitimate.

## Features

* Preprocess email text (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization)
* Extract TF-IDF features
* Train and evaluate ML model
* Streamlit-based web UI for live predictions

## Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, Streamlit

## Dataset

[Phishing Email Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Future Improvements

* Integrate BERT for better accuracy
* Add API for email client integration
* Multi-language phishing detection support
